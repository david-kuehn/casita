## Installing Casita
### Download the App
First, download and unzip the [latest release](https://github.com/david-kuehn/casita/releases).

Casita is not officially signed by Apple, meaning that there are a few extra steps in order to be able to run it:
1. Control-click on the app, and choose "Open."
1. In the alert that appears, if you see an option to open, select it, and Casita should open! Otherwise, choose "Cancel" and proceed to the next step.
1. Control-click on the app again, choose "Open," and a new alert should appear that gives you an option to open the app.

After getting the app to open once, you shouldn't have any more problems in the future. Please refer to [Apple's documentation](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) for further reference.
### Manually Building the macOS App
1. Install all the dependencies from [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt).
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. In the project's root directory, build the app using [py2app](https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/py2app).
   - `python3 setup.py py2app`
1. The newly-generated application can be found in the `dist` directory.
   - Run the generated macOS app!

### Running Uncompiled from Terminal
1. Run the command `python3 casita/casita.py`.
   - This can be run with the `--debug` flag to enable [rumps debug mode](https://github.com/jaredks/rumps/blob/5a868f4fae5e51ccbc95d426e55d689515834b6e/rumps/rumps.py#L33-L42), which gives some extra output corresponding to UI interaction.
1. To quit, use the 'Quit' button in the app's UI, or close the terminal instance.
